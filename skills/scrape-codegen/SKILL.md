You are generating a web-poet page object from an extraction spec. The spec contains
a schema, saved HTML pages, and expected values. It may describe any data type —
product details, navigation links, article content, etc. Codegen doesn't need to
know the data type; it generates a PO that extracts according to the schema.

The spec was produced by `/scrape-spec` and the project by `/scrape-ensure-project`.

## Input

The raw argument string is `$ARGUMENTS`. Split it into up to 3 whitespace-separated positional arguments:

1. **spec_path**: path to spec folder, e.g. `.scrape/books-toscrape`
2. **project_dir**: path to the Scrapy project
3. **fields**: optional, comma-separated field names to generate (empty = all fields)

## Process

### Step 1: Read the spec

Read `{spec_path}/spec.json` to get:
- `schema.properties` — the field definitions
- `html_variant` — which HTML to use (`raw` or `rendered`)
- `url` — the starting URL (used for domain name)
- `data_type` — what's being extracted (used for class naming)

If `fields` is provided, filter `schema.properties` to only include those fields.

List page directories in `{spec_path}/pages/` that have corresponding values in
`{spec_path}/values/`. Read expected values from each.

Derive `site_name` from the spec_path (parent directory name, e.g. `books-toscrape` from `.scrape/books-toscrape/products`).
Detect the project name from `{project_dir}`.

### Step 2: Add item and page object stub

Check `{project_name}/items.py` for an existing item class matching `data_type`.
If none exists, write one based on the schema (all fields optional, `| None = None`).

Add a page object stub:

```
/scrape-add-page-object {project_dir}/{project_name}/pages/{module_name}.py \
    {ClassName} {domain} web_poet.WebPage {project_name}.items.{ItemClass}
```

Use `web_poet.BrowserPage` if `html_variant` is `rendered`.

### Step 3: Convert fixtures

Find the fixture class path from the project structure (e.g.,
`{project_name}.pages.{module_name}.{ClassName}`).

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/convert_fixtures.py \
    {spec_path} {project_dir} {fixture_class_path}
```

### Step 4: Analyze pages (parallel)

```bash
mkdir -p .scrape/.work/{site_name}/codegen-analyze
```

Launch one Agent per page with values, **all in a single message** for parallel
execution. Each agent runs `/scrape-codegen-analyze` with all 4 arguments:

```
/scrape-codegen-analyze {spec_path}/pages/{page_id}/{html_variant}.html .scrape/.work/{site_name} {spec_path}/spec.json {spec_path}/values/{page_id}.json
```

Skip pages whose HTML file doesn't exist.

### Step 5: Generate page object code

After all analysis agents complete, launch a single Agent running
`/scrape-codegen-generate` with all 3 arguments:

```
/scrape-codegen-generate .scrape/.work/{site_name} {project_dir}/{project_name}/pages/{module_name}.py {spec_path}/spec.json
```

### Step 6: Test

```bash
cd {project_dir} && uv run pytest fixtures/ -x -v
```

Report results. If tests fail, read errors and consider re-generating failed fields.

### Step 7: Report

```
Generated page object at {project_dir}/{project_name}/pages/{module_name}.py:
  Class: {ClassName} (N fields)
  Fixtures: N test cases
  Tests: N/N passing
```

## Codegen rules

Follow the web-poet reference at `references/web-poet-reference.md`, plus:

- Keep code simple and domain-general — not overfitted to example pages
- Return `None` for missing data — never empty string, `False`, or `[]`
- Use guard clauses, check for `None` before attribute access
- Don't add docstrings to field methods
- Don't catch generic `Exception` — only specific exceptions
- Prefer deterministic output — avoid sets (use list + dedup if needed)
- If analysis shows a field comes from structured data (JSON-LD, microdata), use
  `extruct` — the metadata format matches `extract_metadata.py` output from earlier
  stages, so the same access patterns work in the page object
