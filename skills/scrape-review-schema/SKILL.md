description: Generate an HTML review page for schema and extracted data verification
argument-hint: "[spec-path] [work-path] [schema-json] [html-variant]"

You are generating a review page that lets the user verify the proposed schema and extracted values in their browser.

## Input

The raw argument string is `$ARGUMENTS`. Split it into up to 5 positional arguments.
The 1st, 2nd and 4th are whitespace-separated tokens; the 3rd and 5th are JSON literals that may contain whitespace —
recognize their boundaries by matching brackets (and strip outer single/double quotes if the caller quoted them):

1. **spec_path**: path to the spec folder, e.g. `.scrape/books-toscrape`
2. **work_path**: path to the working directory, e.g. `.scrape/.work/books-toscrape`
3. **schema**: JSON object literal with the proposed schema (starts with `{`, ends with the matching `}`)
4. **html_variant**: which HTML to use — `raw` or `rendered`
5. **changes** (optional): JSON array literal of change descriptions from the previous round (starts with `[`, ends with the matching `]`), e.g. `["Re-analyzed price across all pages","Dropped field isbn"]`

The schema JSON uses JSON Schema format (see `references/extraction-spec.md` for full details):
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "price": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Product price"
    }
  }
}
```

Fields may also carry a `source` annotation: "requested" (user asked for it) or "discovered" (AI found it).

## Process

### 1. Read analysis data

List page subdirectories in `{spec_path}/pages/` (each subdirectory is a page). For each page, read `{spec_path}/pages/{page_id}/meta.json` for metadata and `{work_path}/analyze-page/{page_id}.{html_variant}.json` for analysis data.

### 2. Create temp directory

```bash
REVIEW_DIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/scrape-review-XXXXXX)
```

### 3. Copy static assets

Copy the bundled assets from this skill's directory to the temp dir:
- `review.html`
- `style.css`
- `review.js`

Use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/` as the source path.

### 4. Copy saved HTML pages

For each page directory in `{spec_path}/pages/`, copy the chosen variant's HTML to `${REVIEW_DIR}/pages/{page_id}.html`:

```bash
cp {spec_path}/pages/{page_id}/{html_variant}.html ${REVIEW_DIR}/pages/{page_id}.html
```

This flattens the directory structure for the review page's iframes.

### 5. Start feedback server

Start a one-shot HTTP server that will receive feedback from the review page:

```bash
FEEDBACK_FILE="${REVIEW_DIR}/feedback.txt"
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/feedback-server.py" "${FEEDBACK_FILE}" &
SERVER_PID=$!
sleep 1
AGENT_PORT=$(cat "${FEEDBACK_FILE}.port")
```

### 6. Generate data.js

Build and write `${REVIEW_DIR}/data.js` with all the data the review page needs.
Include `AGENT_URL` so the review page can send feedback directly.
If `changes` was passed (the optional 5th argument), include `REVIEW_CHANGES` so the page shows what the agent did:

```javascript
const AGENT_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:${AGENT_PORT}/feedback";
const REVIEW_CHANGES = ["Re-analyzed price across all pages", "Dropped field isbn"];
const REVIEW_DATA = {
  fields: [
    {
      name: "price",
      type: "str",
      description: "Product price",
      source: "requested",
      values: {
        "detail-1": {"value": "$29.99", "url": "https://..."},
        "detail-2": {"value": "$49.99", "url": "https://..."}
      }
    }
  ],
  pages: {
    "detail-1": {
      url: "https://...",
      html_file: "pages/detail-1.html"
    }
  }
};
```

### 7. Open in browser and wait for feedback

Open the review page and immediately start waiting for feedback in the same command (so only one approval is needed):

```bash
open "${REVIEW_DIR}/review.html" && while [ ! -f "${FEEDBACK_FILE}" ]; do sleep 1; done && cat "${FEEDBACK_FILE}" && kill $SERVER_PID 2>/dev/null || true
```

Report the review dir path to the user in the message before running this command, in case they need to reopen it.

Return the feedback text to the caller.
